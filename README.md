# Overview
This report presents a detailed analysis and implementation of image classification using feedforward neural networks on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset, available from the Zalando Research GitHub repository, consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each categorized into one of ten classes representing different types of clothing and accessories.

# Data Preparation
The Fashion MNIST dataset is preprocessed and split into training and validation sets. Data loaders are utilized to efficiently load batches of images during training, validation, and testing phases. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as random rotations and flips can be applied to enhance model generalization.

# Model Architecture
The neural network model architecture comprises one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer consists of 784 neurons corresponding to the flattened image pixels (28x28). The hidden layers consist of 16 and 32 neurons, respectively, followed by ReLU activation functions. Finally, the output layer comprises ten neurons representing the ten classes, with softmax activation to compute class probabilities.

# Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization with a specified learning rate. During training, both training and validation losses are monitored to assess model performance. Additionally, accuracy metrics are computed to evaluate the model's classification performance on the validation and test datasets.

Results
After training the model for multiple epochs, both the loss and accuracy metrics are plotted against the number of epochs to visualize the training progress. The trained model achieved significant improvements in both loss reduction and accuracy. Specifically, after running 10 epochs, the validation accuracy reached 0.8529, indicating the model's strong performance in accurately classifying fashion items. Finally, the model's predictions on sample images from the test dataset are showcased, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world classification tasks.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this report illustrates the successful implementation of a feedforward neural network for image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. By leveraging neural network architecture, optimization algorithms, and appropriate data preprocessing techniques, accurate classification results are achieved, showcasing the potential of deep learning in fashion image recognition tasks.
